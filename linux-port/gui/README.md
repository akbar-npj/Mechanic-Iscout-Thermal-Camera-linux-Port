# gui — the Qt6 front end

This directory holds the native GUI. It is a *shell*: every pixel it draws and
every string it shows comes from `libdyt`, and the toolkit-independent parts of
that presentation live in `src/view_model.c`, which the OpenCV viewer
(`tools/dytview.cpp`) consumes too. Neither front end owns a formatting rule, so
they cannot drift apart.

## The window

```
MainWindow : QWidget
└── QVBoxLayout (margins 0, spacing 0)
    ├── FrameView   (stretch 1)   the frame, the colour bar, the bar's labels
    └── StatusStrip (stretch 0)   three left-aligned lines
```

`FrameView` is the only class that knows about pixels, and `StatusStrip` the only
one that knows about text layout. Everything above them deals in the session and
the view model.

The window sizes itself to the canvas: `MainWindow::fit_to_view()` is called once
before the window is shown and again whenever the canvas changes size, which is
what makes the first frame — the first moment the sensor's real, zoomed size is
known — fit rather than be cropped. It uses `resize()`, not `adjustSize()`:
`adjustSize()` clamps its result to two thirds of the screen, so the offscreen
platform's 800×600 screen produced a 533×400 window for a 660×400 canvas, and
`--selftest`'s assertion 7 caught it. A window larger than the screen is the
lesser evil; a silently cropped image is not.

### The three status lines

| line | source | example |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `dyt_vm_status_line()`, verbatim | `mode 1000 \| fusion ir \| 01-iron-red.dat 1/28 \| C \| x2- \| 25 frames` |
| 2 | `dyt_vm_readout_line()`, verbatim | `tool: none (p point, l line, b box, n clear)` |
| 3 | the front end's own | `range auto   \|   FIXTURE  25.0 fps` |

Line 3 carries the two things the view model has no business naming — the frame
rate and the device state — plus the range mode. The mode is formatted by the
engine (`dyt_range_mode_name()`), but it is deliberately **not** folded into
`dyt_vm_status_line()`. That shared line is already ~378 px of a 404 px window at
zoom 1, and `tools/dytview.cpp` draws it into a strip only as wide as the *image*
(256 px at zoom 1), where it is already clipped; extending it would clip further,
and would change another front end's display and its pinned tests for no gain.

The rate is shown only for the states that have painted frames — a `0.0 fps`
beside `CONNECTING` would be a claim about a stream that is not running yet.

### The device state

`next_live()` returns `WAIT` both before the first frame *and* for the whole
start-up filler (`frame_source.c:271`), so the source alone cannot tell "not
connected yet" from "connected, still warming up". The state is therefore decided
from the session's own `seq`/`ready` — the same scalars-only snapshot `next_live()`
takes internally, so it costs nothing.

| state | when | canvas | line 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Fixture` | not `--live` | image | `FIXTURE  <fps> fps` |
| `Connecting` | `--live`, bring-up still running | `connecting to camera…` | `CONNECTING` |
| `NoDevice` | `--live`, bring-up failed | `no camera found (see stderr)` | `NO DEVICE` |
| `WarmingUp` | `--live`, up, but no real frame yet | `warming up - waiting for live data…` | `WARMING UP` |
| `Live` | `--live`, up, real frame | image | `LIVE  <fps> fps` |

`device_state()` is a pure function of five booleans, so every state is reachable
in `--selftest` with no camera attached — which is the only way two of the five
can be tested at all.

**The filler is never painted.** Before it has real data the device streams a flat
`0x8000`, which in mode 1000 decodes to a legitimate-looking **238.85 C**
(`display.h`). Painting it would show a real-looking scene that is not one *and*
collapse the colour scale onto it, so `pump::step()` holds the placeholder
instead. Once a frame *has* been painted the placeholder is ignored, so a live
stall keeps showing the last real frame rather than flickering back.

### Zoom and mirror

`dyt_view_transform_map()` states the contract (`display.h:146`): *"the output is
the source magnified by `zoom` and then mirrored"*. `transformed()` transcribes it
in that order, which is what keeps it a direct expression of the contract the
pointer mapping inverts — a front end that scaled or mirrored differently would
put a click on the wrong pixel.

The two orders happen to *agree* for uniform integer magnification (mirroring a
`z`-times block-magnified image and magnifying a mirrored source both send output
pixel `ox` to source `n-1-ox/z`), so this is not a fix for odd zoom. It is
refusing to depend on that coincidence. Assertion 16 pins the mirror actually
happening, driven directly, because nothing yet sets the flip from the UI.

`Qt::FastTransformation` is mandatory rather than a performance choice: it is Qt's
nearest-neighbour, matching `map()`'s integer division and the OpenCV viewer's
`cv::INTER_NEAREST`. Smooth scaling would put the Qt window's pixels somewhere the
shared pointer mapping does not agree with. `QImage::flipped()` is used rather
than the deprecated `mirrored()`.

## The toolkit decision — Qt6 Widgets

Qt6 was chosen as the toolkit, and within Qt6, **Widgets** rather than Quick/QML.

The deciding fact is what the engine actually produces. `dyt_session_render_rgb()`
hands back a tightly-packed RGB byte buffer, and `src/view_model.c` hands back
finished strings. Widgets consume both directly:

* `QImage(buf, w, h, w*3, QImage::Format_RGB888)` wraps the engine's buffer with
  no conversion, no copy and no format negotiation. Verified, not assumed — see
  the spike below.
* A view-model string goes into a `paintEvent` `drawText` unchanged; there is no
  markup to escape and nothing to re-format.
* The OpenCV viewer's rendering is immediate-mode `cv::rectangle` / `putText`
  calls, which map one-to-one onto `paintEvent`. The layout arithmetic ported
  across unchanged.

QML would instead need an image-provider or texture bridge to get the same
buffer on screen, and would add the QML runtime and scene graph to the
dependency list for no gain — the UI here is a frame, a colour bar, a status
strip and a settings panel, which is exactly what Widgets is for.

The Qt app is an *alternative* front end, not a replacement for the port's rule
that every capability is reachable with no display. `tools/dytview.cpp` remains
the headless-friendly viewer, and both sit on the same `src/view_model.c`.

## How the toolkit was chosen, and the spike that settled it

`dytqt.cpp` began as a spike (task #83) whose job was to answer four questions
with evidence before a window was designed around the answers:

| # | question | answer |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Does the engine's rendered RGB reach a widget without inventing a conversion? | yes — `QImage` over the engine's own buffer, `Format_RGB888`, no copy |
| 2 | Is 25 fps reachable from a `QTimer` without the frame path stalling? | yes — worst single step ≈0.5 ms (0.5–0.9 ms over 8 runs) against the **40 ms** budget, ~45× headroom |
| 3 | Does the view model's status line drop straight into a Qt widget? | yes — the string goes to `drawText` verbatim |
| 4 | Can the whole thing be verified with no display and no device? | yes — `--selftest` under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` |

The spike also caught a real defect, which is the reason it was worth running
rather than reasoning about: sizing the **window** from the **view's**
`sizeHint()` left the status strip to steal ~22 px from the frame, clipping the
image and the colour bar's bottom label. Every other check still passed — a
frame count and a colour count do not notice a missing row. Assertion 7 now pins
the invariant that `win.view()->height() >= win.view()->sizeHint().height()`, so
the failure cannot return silently.

Two more layout traps were found the same way when the real window replaced the
spike, and both are the kind that only a rendered canvas reveals:

* The window does not follow its layout's `sizeHint` once `resize()` or
  `adjustSize()` has been called on it, so the first frame — the first moment the
  sensor's real, zoomed size is known — grew the *canvas* while the *window*
  stayed at the placeholder size. `MainWindow::fit_to_view()` asks explicitly.
* `adjustSize()` clamps to two thirds of the screen. On the offscreen platform's
  800×600 screen that turned a 660×400 canvas into a 533×400 window: clipped,
  which is precisely what assertion 7 exists to catch. `fit_to_view()` uses
  `resize()` instead.

## Build

The app needs Qt6 Widgets. On a distro that names it `qt6-qtbase-devel`:

```
sudo dnf install qt6-qtbase-devel        # Fedora
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev            # Debian/Ubuntu
```

The Makefile detects it through `pkg-config Qt6Widgets` and sets `HAVE_QT6`;
without Qt6 the target is simply absent and every other target still builds.

```
make build/dytqt
```

`-fPIC` is added automatically — Qt6's libraries are built with
`-reduce-relocations`, so an executable linking them must itself be
position-independent.

## Run

```
./build/dytqt                          # replays the default fixture
./build/dytqt --selftest               # headless check, needs no display
./build/dytqt --palette 5 --zoom 3
./build/dytqt --png /tmp/canvas.png    # save the window and exit
```

| option | meaning |
|---|---|
| `--fixture PATH` | raw payload to replay (default `testdata/mode1000_256x384_default.raw`) |
| `--width N` | sensor width of the fixture (default 256) |
| `--palette N` | 1-based palette index (default 1) |
| `--palette-dir D` | where the `*.dat` ramps live (default: search) |
| `--zoom N` | window magnification (default 2) |
| `--frames N` | stop after N frames (default: run until closed) |
| `--fps N` | timer rate (default 25) |
| `--png PATH` | write the canvas here and exit |
| `--selftest` | headless check over the fixture; needs no display |

`--selftest` runs the same code path the window does, under the offscreen
platform plugin, and asserts on the result rather than leaving a human to look
at a window. It is wired into `make check`, so the GUI is part of the CI gate
and not a thing that is only ever run by hand.

```
$ ./build/dytqt --selftest
  ok   painted the requested 25 frame(s) (got 25)
  ok   the frame path fits the 40 ms budget at 25 fps (worst step 2.8 ms)
  ok   the frame is 256x192 (got 256x192)
  ok   the frame converted to real temperatures (min 31.41 C, max 32.41 C)
  ok   the status line is populated ("mode 1000 | fusion ir | 01-iron-red.dat 1/28 | C | x2- | 25 frames")
  ok   the canvas painted (660x456, 64 distinct colours)
  ok   the canvas is not clipped (660x400, wants 660x400)
  ok   the strip has three populated lines
        line 1: mode 1000 | fusion ir | 01-iron-red.dat 1/28 | C | x2- | 25 frames
        line 2: tool: none (p point, l line, b box, n clear)
        line 3: range auto   |   FIXTURE  766.5 fps
  ok   line 3 names the source ("range auto   |   FIXTURE  766.5 fps")
  ok   the range mode reaches the snapshot (auto -> fixed -> auto)
  ok   the engine names the range modes ("auto", "fixed")
  ok   the fps meter is exact (25.0 fps)
  ok   a filler frame is not a live frame (ready 0, WARMING UP)
  ok   a failed bring-up is a state, not a crash (NO DEVICE)
  ok   zoom 2 is applied to the frame (512x384, hint 660x400)
  ok   the mirror is applied (zoom 2, flip_h, 6x2, ends #0000ff/#ff0000)
=== ALL PASS ===
```

Two of these are worth calling out because they are the ones that would otherwise
pass vacuously:

* **Assertion 4** is what makes the rest mean something. Mode 1000's start-up
  filler is a flat `0x8000` → ~238.85 C, so a frame near that value means the
  fixture was replayed *without* being converted. The fixture is ~31.4–32.4 C.
* **Assertion 15** requires `zoom > 1` on purpose: at zoom 1 the geometry
  relation it checks would hold for an untransformed frame too, and would prove
  nothing.

The `766.5 fps` on line 3 is not a bug — `--selftest` paces nothing, so it runs
the 25 frames as fast as it can. Assertion 9 checks the *label* there and
assertion 12 pins the arithmetic instead.

## Where the frames come from, and on which thread

Both the window and `--selftest` replay a frozen fixture through
`tools/frame_source.c`, which runs the real device-free pipeline
(`dyt_pipeline_resolve/frame`, `dyt_visible_extract`, `dyt_session_process`)
exactly as the live capture adapter does. So the app needs no camera to be
built, run or tested.

The device path needs **no queued signal**, which is worth recording because the
spike's NOTE assumed otherwise. A live frame is installed by the adapter
(`src/session_capture.c`) on libuvc's callback thread, and the pump only ever
*reads* the session through its own lock (`dyt_session_snapshot`, via
`dyt_vm_grab`). The widget tree is therefore only ever touched on the GUI thread,
and the poll model stated in `session.h` already covers the hand-off.
`src/frame_ready.c` exists to *wake* a poller on demand instead of polling on a
timer; it is an optimisation, not a correctness requirement, and is not wired in
yet.

## What is *not* established

* **The device path.** `dytqt` is fixture-only so far: `--live`, the capture
  options, bring-up and teardown are the second half of task #86.
  `dyt_frame_source_open_live()` is the intended entry point, and the state
  machine it feeds is already written and pinned.
* **`dyt_capture_open()` has no timeout.** Every libuvc control transfer in it
  passes timeout `0`, which libusb reads as *wait indefinitely*, so a wedged
  device can hang the GUI thread with no way out — the window would freeze and a
  `QTimer` could not rescue it, because the GUI thread is the one blocked. This
  is the strongest argument for the worker thread task #87 will add. For this
  milestone it is accepted and documented; the forced paint before bring-up
  covers the ordinary slow-open case, which is tens of milliseconds.
* **Interaction.** `src/view_model.c` already provides the pointer→tool mapping
  (`dyt_vm_tool_mouse`) and the parameter arm/confirm machine
  (`dyt_vm_param_key`), and both are pinned by `view_model_test`. The window does
  not yet route Qt mouse and key events into them, so the tool and settings UI is
  unexercised — tasks #88 and #89. That is also why assertion 16 drives the
  transform directly: no key sets the flip yet.
* **High-DPI and scaling.** The window paints at 1:1 device pixels. Qt's
  automatic scaling is untested here.
* **Only a smoke test on a real compositor.** The window was shown and painted
  twelve frames on Wayland to prove the platform plugin loads, a window maps and
  the resized layout settles; that is not a sustained run, and it is not part of
  `make check`.
